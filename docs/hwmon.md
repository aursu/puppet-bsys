## ACPI Error Fix

### Example Errors
```
[42944462.399858] ACPI Error: No handler for Region [POWR] (00000000978931e9) [IPMI] (20190816/evregion-129)
[42944462.402579] ACPI Error: Region IPMI (ID=7) has no handler (20190816/exfldio-261)
[42944462.404582] No Local Variables are initialized for Method [_PMM]
[42944462.404584] No Arguments are initialized for method [_PMM]
[42944462.404593] ACPI Error: Aborting method \_SB.PMI0._PMM due to previous error (AE_NOT_EXIST) (20190816/psparse-529)
[42944462.406488] ACPI Error: AE_NOT_EXIST, Evaluating _PMM (20190816/power_meter-325)
```

These errors, logged by `dmesg`, are related to ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) and indicate an issue with the system's ACPI tables, specifically the IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface) and power meter functionality.

### **Understanding Related Issues**

On certain systems (e.g., Hewlett Packard G7, G8, and G9 servers), similar errors such as the following may appear:
```
[17377.371160] ACPI Error: SMBus or IPMI write requires Buffer of length 42, found length 20 (20090903/exfield-286)
[17377.371166] ACPI Error: Method parse/execution failed [\_SB_.PMI0._PMM] (Node ffff88201894eb28), AE_AML_BUFFER_LIMIT
[17377.371176] ACPI Exception: AE_AML_BUFFER_LIMIT, Evaluating _PMM (20090903/power_meter-347)
```

These errors indicate discrepancies between the BIOS and kernel concerning ACPI buffer sizes, particularly for power monitoring functionality.

### **Explanation of Errors**

1. **ACPI Error: No handler for Region [POWR]**  
   - The ACPI firmware defines a `POWR` region with IPMI as the handler, but the kernel lacks the necessary driver to manage it.

2. **Region IPMI (ID=7) has no handler**  
   - The kernel cannot find a handler for the IPMI region, possibly due to a missing kernel module or unsupported firmware implementation.

3. **No Local Variables / No Arguments are initialized for method [_PMM]**  
   - The ACPI method `_PMM` is invoked but fails because required handlers are not present.

4. **Aborting method \_SB.PMI0._PMM due to previous error (AE_NOT_EXIST)**  
   - The `_PMM` ACPI method is aborted because it depends on the missing handler.

5. **AE_NOT_EXIST, Evaluating _PMM**  
   - The kernel fails to evaluate `_PMM`, likely related to the power meter's functionality.

### **Possible Causes**

- **Firmware Issue**: Incomplete or incorrect ACPI tables provided by the system's firmware.
- **Missing Kernel Driver**: Kernel modules required for IPMI or ACPI power meter handling are not loaded.
- **Unsupported ACPI Feature**: The firmware uses ACPI features not supported by the Linux kernel.

### **SUSE Recommended Solution**

1. **BIOS Update**  
   - The root cause is often an issue in the system's ACPI tables provided by the BIOS. Updating the BIOS/UEFI firmware is the recommended solution. Check with your hardware vendor for available updates.

2. **Blacklist `acpi_power_meter` Module**  
   - If a BIOS update is not feasible, blacklist the `acpi_power_meter` module, as the driver doesn't function due to the incorrect buffer size:
     ```bash
     echo "blacklist acpi_power_meter" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/hwmon.conf
     ```

3. **Custom ACPI Tables (Advanced)**  
   - For advanced users, you can provide a custom ACPI table to replace the faulty one, correcting the buffer size from `Buffer (0x20)` to `Buffer (0x42)`.  
   - **Caution**: This is a complex solution requiring significant expertise and must be repeated for every affected machine. Proceed with care.

4. **Load Missing Kernel Modules**
   - On systems with updated kernels (version `3.0.26-0.7.6` or higher), ensure the required kernel modules are loaded to resolve related errors:
     ```bash
     modprobe ipmi_si
     modprobe acpi_ipmi
     modprobe acpi_power_meter
     ```

5. **Testing**
   - Locate a valid power meter device:
     ```bash
     find /sys/devices/LNXSYSTM\:00/ | grep ACPI000D
     ```
   - Try reading the power average:
     ```bash
     cat /sys/devices/LNXSYSTM:00/device:00/ACPI000D:00/power1_average
     ```
   - Check logs (`/var/log/messages` or `dmesg`) for errors.

### **Actions to Resolve or Mitigate**

#### 1. **Verify Kernel Modules**

- **IPMI Kernel Modules**:
  Load the required kernel modules to handle IPMI and ACPI functionalities:

  ```bash
  modprobe ipmi_si
  modprobe ipmi_devintf
  modprobe acpi_ipmi
  ```
- Verify if the modules are loaded:

  ```bash
  lsmod | grep -E 'ipmi|acpi_ipmi'
  ```

- To make these modules persistent across reboots, add them to `/etc/modules`:

  ```bash
  echo -e "ipmi_si\nipmi_devintf\nacpi_ipmi" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
  ```
#### 2. **Update System Firmware**

Check for BIOS/UEFI firmware updates from your hardware vendor. These updates often resolve ACPI table issues.

#### 3. **Update the Kernel**

Make sure you're using the latest kernel version for your distribution. Newer kernels may have better support for your hardware's ACPI implementation.

#### 4. **Review Logs**
Check `dmesg` or system logs to confirm the resolution:

```bash
dmesg | grep -i acpi
sudo journalctl -k | grep -i acpi
```

### **Steps to Load and Test `acpi_ipmi`**

#### 1. **Load the Module**
Run the following command to load the `acpi_ipmi` module:
```bash
sudo modprobe acpi_ipmi
```

#### 2. **Check if the Module is Loaded**
Verify that the module has been successfully loaded:
```bash
lsmod | grep acpi_ipmi
```

#### 3. **Recheck dmesg**
After loading the module, check the kernel logs to see if the ACPI errors have been resolved:
```bash
dmesg | grep -i acpi
```

#### 4. **Make the Module Persistent**
If loading `acpi_ipmi` resolves the issue, ensure it is loaded automatically at boot by adding it to `/etc/modules`:
```bash
echo acpi_ipmi | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
```

### **Why `acpi_ipmi` Is Relevant**
The errors in your `dmesg` logs specifically mention an IPMI region (`Region [POWR] (00000000978931e9) [IPMI]`), and the kernel cannot find a handler for it. The `acpi_ipmi` module acts as the bridge between ACPI and the IPMI subsystem in the Linux kernel. If the module is not loaded, the kernel cannot process these ACPI-defined regions, resulting in errors.

### **Conclusion**
These errors often do not affect core system functionality but can prevent certain management features (e.g., power metering) from working. By ensuring the required kernel modules (`ipmi_si`, `ipmi_devintf`, `acpi_ipmi`) are loaded, updating system firmware, or applying kernel parameters, you can resolve or mitigate these issues.

### **Final Recommendations**
- Update the BIOS/UEFI firmware as the primary solution.
- Blacklist the `acpi_power_meter` module if the power monitoring functionality is non-critical.
- For persistent functionality issues, ensure the required kernel modules (`ipmi_si`, `acpi_ipmi`, and `acpi_power_meter`) are loaded.
- If critical, consider advanced solutions such as creating custom ACPI tables or consulting the hardware vendor for further assistance.
